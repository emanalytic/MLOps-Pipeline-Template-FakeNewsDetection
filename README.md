# Getting Started
Before diving into the pipeline, I encourage you to explore your data and try different models using the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook. It's essential to identify which model performs best for your specific use case.

## Utilities and Logging
To ensure high-quality code and maintainability, I've included a utilities module in src/utils/.

- `config.py`: A configuration parser utility that helps in dynamically reading your settings from `config/settings.ini`. It ensures that your scripts have access to up-to-date configurations without hardcoding values.
- `logger.py`: A custom logging utility that wraps around Python's built-in logging module. It provides a consistent logging interface for your application, making debugging and monitoring the pipeline's performance easier. You can track the execution flow, errors, and informative messages that help in maintaining a clean execution log for audit and debugging purposes.
To utilize the logger, simply import it in your scripts and use it to log messages at different severity levels

#### Customize Your Configuration
Set data sources and model parameters in `config/settings.ini`.
- Adapt `src/pipeline/stage_01_ingestion.py` for your data ingestion needs.
  
## Executing the Pipeline
Run the pipeline with these commands:
``` sh
python main.py ingest
python main.py preprocess
python main.py train
python main.py evaluate
```

## Tailoring the Pipeline Steps
Customize the scripts in `src/pipeline/` to match your machine learning tasks.

*I used Logistic Regression for Fake News Detection; feel free to adapt or choose a more complex model.* 

## For API and Docker Deployment
- Tailor the `api/api.py` to set up your prediction endpoints.
- Adjust the `Dockerfile` to bundle your API and model into a container for deployment.

If you're unfamiliar with Docker or how to use it, start by reading this article: [How Docker Containers Work](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-docker-used-for-a-docker-container-tutorial-for-beginners/), and then watch the video: [Build YOUR OWN Dockerfile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnSH8Ht3MIc).

## CI/CD Integration

Take advantage of the `.github/workflows` templates included in this project to set up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) with GitHub Actions and Azure. CI/CD helps automate steps in your software delivery process, such as initiating automatic builds and deployments.

For a deeper understanding of CI/CD principles and benefits, read the article: [Building an Effective CI/CD Pipeline: A Comprehensive Guide](https://gartsolutions.medium.com/building-an-effective-ci-cd-pipeline-a-comprehensive-guide-bb07343).

## Deployment on Azure using GitHub Actions

To get started with deploying on Azure, ensure you have an Azure subscription. If you're a student, you're in luck! You can sign up for the Azure for Students offer, which provides you with **$100** in Azure credits for the first year.

Here's a quick rundown:

1. Sign up for Azure if you haven't already. If you're a student, access your free credits through the [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) offer.
2. Once you have your subscription, log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and create a resource group.(Ask ChatGPT that how to create a resource group using azure portal or azure CLI)
3. With your environment set up, you'll use the Azure CLI for the next steps. If you don't have it installed, follow the instructions here:
[Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

4. After setting up the CLI, use the `az login` command to log in to your Azure account.
5. Proceed with the rest of the required steps to configure your GitHub Actions for Azure deployment. A detailed tutorial is available here:
 [Deploying Docker to Azure App Service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/deploying-to-your-cloud-provider/deploying-to-azure/deploying-docker-to-azure-app-service).
   
*This setup allows you to deploy any containerized application seamlessly using GitHub Actions directly to Azure App Service.*

## Integrating the Fake News Detection API

I have developed a Fake News Detection API that is ready to be integrated into your applications. You can easily leverage this API for real-time predictions by sending requests to the `/predict` endpoint. The model backing this API boasts a high F1 score of 0.98 on testing data, indicating its reliability and precision.

### !Note
It can be significantly improved by you. While version control could elevate your project, I've avoided using it here to keep things simple. Additionally, more advanced technologies could be considered
